            {/* Personal story and experience */}
            My engineering journey began out of necessity to start my own
            business with my wife, Jessela. But along the way, I discovered a
            deep passion for the field, especially for full-stack engineering
            and architecture. Through dedicated effort, I&apos;ve amassed almost
            2000 practical hours and have become comfortable with any syntax,
            largely due to the advent of ChatGPT, which has become an integral
            tool in my work.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            {/* More details about projects and skills */}
            I&apos;ve used my skills to create various projects and maintain our
            business systems, including our eCommerce platform on Shopify&apos;s
            Liquid framework, and our business site built with React. I have a
            diverse portfolio that showcases my skills in AI training, web
            design, Python scripting, and more. I also have research access to
            GPT4&apos;s API and have received invitations for certification from
            the EC-Council in light of my practical experience.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            {/* Future goals */}
            On the business side, Jessela and I bootstrapped costs over $20,000
            to launch our eCommerce platform, with a focus on community impact
            and environmental consciousness. As we transition into the
            maintenance phase of our start-up, I&apos;m excited to deploy my
            newfound skills in the tech industry.
