# App.js

The `App.js` file serves as the entry point to the application and sets up the main structure for the React web application using the React Router.

## Functionality

1. **Importing Dependencies**: The necessary React and React Router components are imported at the beginning of the file.

2. **App Function**: The `App()` function is the main functional component that represents the entire application.

3. **Router Setup**: The application uses the `BrowserRouter` from React Router to handle routing. The `Router` wraps the entire application, enabling navigation between different components based on the specified routes.

4. **Header Component**: The `Header` component is imported and rendered at the top of the application, providing navigation links to different pages.

5. **Routes Configuration**: The `Routes` component is used to configure the available routes in the application. It contains multiple `Route` components, each representing a specific page or component. The `path` prop specifies the URL path for each route, and the `element` prop associates each route with its corresponding component.

6. **Homepage, About, Repositories, and Contact Components**: These components represent the content for different pages in the application and are rendered based on the corresponding routes defined in the `Routes`.

7. **Footer Component**: The `Footer` component is imported and rendered at the bottom of the application, providing additional information or navigation links.

8. **Exporting App**: The `App` component is exported to be used as the root component for the React application.
